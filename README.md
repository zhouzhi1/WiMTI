## ðŸ“– Overview

This dataset is a publicly available subset extracted from the proprietary CSI dataset used in the WiMTI study. It is released to support reproducibility, peer evaluation, and future research on multitask learning for WiFi sensing. The dataset includes Channel State Information (CSI) sequences with dual-task labels: identity and posture.
